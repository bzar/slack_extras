# slack_extras
A weechat plugin for wee-slack convenience stuff

This weechat plugin adds some functionality on top of wee-slack I felt I needed but don't consider general use enough to warrant a pull request to the main plugin.

## Features

### /close_threads
Closes all slack threadÂ buffers.

### /close_dms
Closes all slack direct message buffers.
